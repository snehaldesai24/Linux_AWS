# AWS:
========================
What is Infrastructure?
========================

=> Resources required to run our business.

IT Infrastructure : 

1) Machines
2) Servers
3) Databases
4) Storage
5) Network
6) Power
7) Security
8) Backup
9) Monitoring

=> We can deal with IT infrastructure in 2 ways 

	1) On-Prem infrastructure

	2) Cloud Infrastructure

=> On-Prem infrastructure means we need to purchase everything and manage everything on our own.

=> We have to deal with below challenges when we go for on-prem infrastructure

1) Lot of investment
2) Scalability 
3) Availability
4) Security
5) Storage
6) Monitoring

=> To overcome the challenges with On-Prem infrastructure, companies are moving to cloud computing.

==========================
What is Cloud Computing ?
==========================

=> The process of delivering IT resources over the internet on demand basis is called as Cloud Computing.

=> Cloud Computing works based on pay as you go model.

=> We have below advantages with cloud computing

1) Pay as you go 

2) Scalability

3) Availability (24/7)

4) Unlimited Storage 

5) Security

6) Backup & Restore

7) Monitoring

===============
Cloud Provider
===============

=> The company which is providing IT infrastructure based on 
"pay as you go" model.

1) Amazon => AWS 

2) Microsoft => AZURE

3) Google => GCP 

4) Salesforce

=====================
Cloud Service Models
=====================

1) IAAS : Infrastructure as a service

2) PAAS : Platform as a service 

3) SAAS : Software as a service


==========
AWS Cloud
==========

=> AWS stands for Amazon Webservices.

=> Amazon company started AWS cloud in 2006.

=> Today 190+ countries using AWS cloud services

=> Instead of we are puchasing, managing and maintaining infrastructure simply we can use AWS cloud infrastructure.

=> AWS providing services based on pay as you go model.

=> AWS having global infrastructure using Regions & Availability Zones.

=> We can create free tier account (1 year validity)

=> In AWS cloud we have 200+ services (some are free and some are paid)

=> If we use paid service in AWS, bill be generated.

Note: in AWS, bill amount auto-deduction will not happen. If we don't pay bill amount aws will suspend our account.

Note: As a beginner we can request AWS support team to get free credits.


=============
AWS Services
=============

EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud => Virtual Servers

S3 : Simple Storage Service => Unlimited Storage

=====
EC2
=====

=> EC2 means elastic compute cloud 

=> It is used to create virtual machines in aws cloud

    EC2 instance = server/machine/vm/instance 

=> EC2 is a paid service 

=> Minimum billing period for EC2 instance is 1 hour.

	9:15 AM - 9:30 AM ===> 1 hour
	
	9:45 AM - 10:00 AM ===> 1 hour
	
=> For practice purpose we can use "t2.micro/t3.micro" instances for 1 year (monthly 750 hours free of cost).	

=> To create EC2 instance we will use below resources 

	1) AMI (OS)
	2) Instance Type (configuration)
	3) Key Pair (.pem)
	4) VPC (networking)
	5) Security Group (firewall rules)
	6) EBS (storage)
	

=> Windows Machines will run on RDP protocol and Linux machines will run on SSH protocol.

		RDP => 3389
		
		SSH => 22

=====================
What is Web server ?
======================

=> Web Server is a software which is used to run web applications.

=> Web applications are divided into 2 types 

	1) static web application
	
	2) dynamic web application	

=> The web app which is giving same response for every user is called as static web application.

Note: To run static websites we can use "httpd" as a webserver.

=> The web app which is giving response based on user is called as dynamic web application.		

Note: To run dynamic website we can use "apache tomcat" as webserver.

=============================================
Hosting static website using amazon linux vm
=============================================

Step-1 : Create EC2 VM with amazon linux ami

Step-2 : Connect with EC2 VM using SSH Client

Step-3 : Install "HTTPD" webserver to run static websites

Step-4 : Setup webpages (html files)

Step-5 : Enable http protocol with 80 port number in SG inbound rules.

Step-6 : Access website using EC2 VM public ip in our browser. 


-------------------------------------
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start

cd /var/www/html

vi index.html
-------------------------------------

Website URl : http://public-ip/




=====================
What is user data ?
=====================

=> It is used to execute the script while launching EC2 VM.

Note: User data will execute only once when the machine is started.

#! /bin/bash

sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Welcome to AWS Cloud</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start


=============
Assignment 
=============

=> Setup a static website using "nginx" web server using EC2 Linux VM.



=======================
What is Load Balancer
=======================

=> When we run our application in single server then we have to face below challenges

	1) One server should handle all reqs
	2) Burden will increase on server
	3) Response will be delayed for clients
	4) Server can crash
	5) Single Point Of Failure
	6) Business Loss

=> To avoid above problems, we will run our application using Load Balancer.

=> Load Balancer is used to distribute load to multiple servers in round robbin fashion.

=> We have below advantages with Load Balancer

	1) App will run in multiple severs

	2) Load will be distributed

	3) Burden will be reduces on servers

	4) Fast Performance

	5) High Availability


=> We have 4 types of load balancers in aws

	1) Application Load Balancer

	2) Network Load balancer

	3) Gateway Load Balancer

	4) Classic Load balancer (previous generation)

=======================
Load Balancer Lab Task
=======================

#### Step-1) Create EC2 VM-1 with below user data

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

#### Step-2) Create EC2 VM-2 with below user data

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

### Step-3) Add these 2 instances to one "Target Group"

### Step-4) Create Load Balancer with Target Group (ALB)

			Schme : Internet Facing
			select target group we have created


### Step-5) Access our aplication using LBR DNS URL	

=============
Auto Scaling
=============

=> Auto scaling is used to increase or decrease no.of servers based on incoming traffic.

		scale up -> increase the servers when required

		scale down -> decrease the servers when not required

=> We have below advantages with auto scaling

		1) high availability

		2) fault tolerance

		3) cost management

===========
S3 Service
===========

-> Simple Storage Service 

-> Unlimited storage

-> S3 supports object based storage

Object = file (txt, pdf, audio, video, img, excel)

-> In S3, objects will be stored using bucket concept

	one bucket = collection of objects
	
Note: When we upload object into bucket it will generate one URL for every object.


-> Bucket versioning : Maintain multiple versions of same object (file)

-> Object Lock : Give only read permissions


=================================
Static website hosting using S3
=================================

1) Create a bucket in s3 with unique name 

2) Upload website files as objects in the bucket 

3) Go to bucket properties and enable static website hosting.

		index file : index.html 
		
		error file : error.html
		
4) Access our static website using Website Endpoint url.		

Note: Static website URL will be length, we can map it to domain name using Route 53.

===========
Assignment
===========

=> Develop a web application with below fields in the form.

Name : text field
Email : text field 
Phno :  text field 
Resume : - select file -

Note: When we submit the form resume should be uploaded into AWS s3 bucket as a object and store name, email, phno, resume_url in database table.


=====
IAM 
=====

=> Identity and Access Management in AWS Cloud.

=> Using this IAM service, we can manage users and user permissions in AWS cloud.

=> In AWS cloud, we can have 2 types of user 

		1) Root user 
		
		2) IAM user 
		
=> Root user is a powerful user, can access everything in aws cloud.

=> For IAM user we can manage permissions (limited access.

=> We can access AWS services in 2 ways 

		1) Console Access 
				- username
				- password
		
		2) Programmatic Access
				- Access key
				- Secret Access key
